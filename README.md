Using Classification for Determining Survival Rate From Thoracic Surgery Data

The data was collected at the Wroclaw Thoracic Surgery Centre for patients who underwent major lung
surgery for lung cancer in the years 2007 - 2011. The Centre is associated with the Department of
Thoracic Surgery of the Medical University of Wroclaw and Lower-Silesian Centre for Pulmonary
Diseases, Poland. The ThoracicSurgery dataset contains information for approximately 470 patients.
There are seventeen variables recorded for each patient. The objective is to predict whether the
patient survives the first year following surgery (Death_1yr).

The ThoracicSurgery dataset contains the following 17 Variables for the 470 patients:
  Diagnosis : ICD-10 codes for primary and secondary as well multiple tumours if any (‘DGN1’,‘DGN2’, ’DGN3’, ’DGN4’, ’DGN5’, ’DGN6’, ’DGN8’)
  FVC : Forced vital capacity - Amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible
  FEV : Volume that has been exhaled at the end of the first second of forced expiration (FEV)
  Performance : Performance status on Zubrod scale (‘PRZ0’ - Good , ‘PRZ1’, ‘PRZ2’ - Poor)
  Pain : Pain before surgery (‘T’, ‘F’)
  Haemoptysis : Coughing up blood before surgery (‘T’, ’F’)
  Dyspnoea : Difficult or laboured breathing before surgery (‘T’, ’F’)
  Cough : Symptoms of coughing before surgery (‘T’, ’F’)
  Weakness : Weakness before surgery (‘T’, ’F’)
  Tumor_Size : Size of the original tumor, from ‘OC11’ (smallest) to ‘OC14’ (largest)
  Diabetes : Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (‘T’, ’F’)
  MI_6mo : Myocardial infarction up to 6 months prior (‘T’, ’F’)
  PAD : Peripheral arterial diseases (‘T’, ’F’)
  Smoking : Patient smoked (‘T’, ’F’)
  Asthma : Patient has asthma (‘T’, ’F’)
  Age : Age at surgery (years)
  Death_1yr : One year survival period - (T) value if died (‘T’, ’F’)
